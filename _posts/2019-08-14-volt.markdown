Volt Bank is a blah bank with ambition to transform the way Australians do banking. Inline with that ambition, I was tasked to transform their space by bringing their new brand to life with colour and excitement. 

The journey to transformation started with a thorough survey of their existing space, their new brand vision and their work space culture.

Based on the client's preference ascertained from the proof of concepts, a range of 3D design concepts were further developed to bring the vision to life.
